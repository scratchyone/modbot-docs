# Tickets

## Create a Ticket

You can create a ticket by running `m: ticket create <MODERATOR_ROLE> <USER>`. Moderator role is the role that will be allowed to view the ticket, and user is the person who the ticket was created for. A ticket is a custom private channel created to allow your mod team to talk with a user.

### Examples

#### Create a ticket with @BadPerson

```
m: ticket create @Moderators @PadPerson
```

## Delete a Ticket

You can delete a ticket by running `m: ticket delete` inside of the ticket channel.

### Examples

#### Delete a ticket

```
m: ticket delete
```
