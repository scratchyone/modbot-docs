## Inviting the Bot

You can invite the bot to your servers with [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=738517864016773241&permissions=2146958847&scope=bot).

## First Steps

It's highly recommended that you create an alertchannel so that you can get warnings when something goes wrong. To create an alertchannel, just run this command:

```
m: alertchannel enable
```
